# Portfolio of Helwan MEROUK

<br>

## Presentation
My name is Helwan, I am 20 years old and I am currently in the third year of Bachelor Digital Project Manager specializing in web development at ECV Digital in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. I follow this work-study program, under an apprenticeship contract with the network and telecommunications company: IP Directions.

<br>

## Professional project
My school career from high school is only technical, I naturally want to move towards software or website development services. I aim to continue the Master 2 course in web development offered by my school, also under an apprenticeship contract.
